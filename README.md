## Coding guide

The following section describes how to run the .ipynb-notebooks in order to make the application work. 

---------------------------------------

### Notebooks:

**app.ipynb**: The application notebook. Set 'user inputs' and run this to see how the application works. 

---------------------------------------

Notebooks that do not need to be run. Optionally, they can all be run again if interested:

**data_acquisition.ipynb**: This notebook acquires the data from Open Street Map using OSMnx. It does not need to be run because the data
is already in the data-folder.

**data_preprocessing.ipynb**: This notebook preprocesses the data achieved from data_acquisition.ipynb. It does not need to be run because the data
is already in the data-folder.

---------------------------------------

### Data:

**data**: All data generated and used in the application can be found in the "data"-folder.
**plots**: Visualisations
